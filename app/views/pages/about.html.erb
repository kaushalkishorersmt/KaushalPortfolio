        <p class="lead">With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p>
        <p class="lead">
        For this reason I decided to utilize a completely defferent development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is alligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.
